# bold_font Operator Mono Thick
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium
# or
# font_family SF Mono Medium

# You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut that is
# assigned in the default configuration.
# 
# You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single shortcut, using the
# syntax below:
# map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...
# For example:
# map ctrl+shift+e combine : new_window : next_layout
# this will create a new window and switch to the next available layout

# You can also open a new window running an arbitrary program, for example:
# map ctrl+shift+y      new_window mutt
# You can also pass the current selection to the new program by using the @selection placeholder
# map ctrl+shift+y      new_window less @selection
# Finally, you can even send the contents of the current screen + history buffer as stdin using
# the placeholders @text (which is the plain text) and @ansi (which includes text styling escape codes)
# For example, the following command opens the scrollback buffer in less in a new window.
# map ctrl+shift+y      new_window @ansi less +G -R

# Sending arbitrary text on shortcut key presses
# You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to
# the client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example:
# send_text all ctrl+alt+a Special text
# This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+a key combination.
# The text to be sent is a python string literal so you can use escapes like
# \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send unicode characters (or you can
# just input the unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument
# to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
# values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated combination of them.
# The special keyword all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
# the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty
# extended keyboard protocol. Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor
# to the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key):
# send_text normal ctrl+alt+a Word\x1b[H
# send_text application ctrl+alt+a Word\x1bOH
