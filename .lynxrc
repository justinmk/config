# preferred_charset specifies the character set in MIME notation (e.g.,
# ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-5) which Lynx will indicate you prefer in requests
# to http servers using an Accept-Charset header.  The value should NOT
# include ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, since those values are always assumed
# by default.  May be a comma-separated list.
# If a file in that character set is available, the server will send it.
# If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any
# character set is acceptable.  If an Accept-Charset header is present,
# and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable
# according to the Accept-Charset header, then the server SHOULD send
# an error response, though the sending of an unacceptable response
# is also allowed.
preferred_charset=

# preferred_language specifies the language in MIME notation (e.g., en,
# fr, may be a comma-separated list in decreasing preference)
# which Lynx will indicate you prefer in requests to http servers.
# If a file in that language is available, the server will send it.
# Otherwise, the server will send the file in its default language.

# select_popups specifies whether the OPTIONs in a SELECT block which
# lacks a MULTIPLE attribute are presented as a vertical list of radio
# buttons or via a popup menu.  Note that if the MULTIPLE attribute is
# present in the SELECT start tag, Lynx always will create a vertical list
# of checkboxes for the OPTIONs.  A value of "on" will set popup menus
# as the default while a value of "off" will set use of radio boxes.
# The default can be overridden via the -popup command line toggle.
select_popups=on

# show_color specifies how to set the color mode at startup.  A value of
# "never" will force color mode off (treat the terminal as monochrome)
# at startup even if the terminal appears to be color capable.  A value of
# "always" will force color mode on even if the terminal appears to be
# monochrome, if this is supported by the library used to build lynx.
# A value of "default" will yield the behavior of assuming
# a monochrome terminal unless color capability is inferred at startup
# based on the terminal type, or the -color command line switch is used, or
# the COLORTERM environment variable is set.  The default behavior always is
# used in anonymous accounts or if the "option_save" restriction is set.

# user_mode specifies the users level of knowledge with Lynx.  The
# default is "NOVICE" which displays two extra lines of help at the
# bottom of the screen to aid the user in learning the basic Lynx
# commands.  Set user_mode to "INTERMEDIATE" to turn off the extra info.
# Use "ADVANCED" to see the URL of the currently selected link at the
# bottom of the screen.
